  abstract = {For a numerical semigroup S⊆N, let m,e,c,g denote its multiplicity, embedding dimension, conductor and genus, respectively. Wilf's conjecture (1978) states that e(c−g)≥c. As of 2023, Wilf's conjecture has been verified by computer up to genus g≤66. In this paper, we extend the verification of Wilf's conjecture up to genus g≤100. This is achieved by combining three main ingredients: (1) a theorem in 2020 settling Wilf's conjecture in the case e≥m/3, (2) an efficient trimming of the tree T of numerical groups identifying and cutting out irrelevant subtrees, and (3) the implementation of a fast parallelized algorithm to construct the tree T up to a given genus. We further push the verification of Wilf's conjecture up to genus 120 in the particular case where m divides c. Finally, we unlock three previously unknown values of the number ng of numerical semigroups of genus g, namely for g=73,74,75.},

The search for counterexamples for the conjecture of Wilf is therefore reduced to semigroups which have an associated negative Eliahou number. Eliahou mentioned 5 numerical semigroups whose Eliahou number is {\$}{\$}-1{\$}{\$} 1. The examples were discovered by Fromentin who observed that these are the only ones with negative Eliahou number among the over {\$}{\$}10^{\{}13{\}}{\$}{\$} 10^13 numerical semigroups of genus up to 60. We prove here that for any integer n there are infinitely many numerical semigroups S such that {\$}{\$}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}E{\}}{\}}{\}}(S)=n{\$}{\$} E(S) = n, by explicitly giving families of such semigroups. We prove that all the semigroups in these families satisfy Wilf's conjecture, thus providing not previously known examples of semigroups for which the conjecture holds.},
